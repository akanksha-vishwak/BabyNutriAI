# Things I learned:

1. Switched to Request Body instead of query parameter
    (I had to use `def chat_with_bot(request: ChatRequest):` instead of `def chat_with_bot(usert_message: str):`)
    - FastAPI allows data to be sent in two ways:
        1️⃣ Query Parameters (/chat?user_message=Hello)

        Passed directly in the URL.
        Good for short, simple inputs like filters or settings.

        2️⃣ Request Body (JSON: {"user_message": "Hello"})

        Passed inside the request payload (more structured).
        Good for complex inputs (like user messages, objects, multiple fields).

2. Extract the information so that GPT-4 sees a controlled version which improves response accuracy and also prepare for RAG

# Want to Learn the following

Companies today are hyping AI integration, especially LLMs (Large Language Models) like ChatGPT, and they want to know if candidates can use, build, and deploy AI-powered applications.

Since you’ve already used the OpenAI API to build a chatbot, you have some exposure! But let’s break down what’s actually important to learn so you don’t feel left behind.
🔹 What Companies Mean by "Do You Know AI Integration?"

They’re asking if you can:
✅ Use LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) via APIs to automate workflows.
✅ Fine-tune or train models for specific company needs.
✅ Deploy AI-powered applications (chatbots, search engines, document summarization tools).
✅ Optimize and customize AI models (prompt engineering, embeddings, RAG).

So, yes—your pizza-order chatbot is a basic example of AI integration! But in industry, companies want LLMs embedded into their products and workflows for:

    Customer support automation (Chatbots for finance, healthcare, HR).
    AI-driven search & recommendation systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG).
    Summarization & report generation (LLMs analyzing documents).

🔹 Key AI Skills to Learn for Industry (Without Overload!)

Here’s what will actually help you get noticed without wasting time on hype:
✅ 1. LLM APIs & Chatbot Development (You already started!)

    How to use OpenAI, Claude, Gemini APIs for building AI-powered apps.
    What to Learn?
        OpenAI API (GPT-4) → https://platform.openai.com/docs/
        LangChain → https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction (Framework for LLM apps).
        Hands-on: Make your chatbot smarter by adding memory, knowledge base (vector database).

✅ 2. Embeddings & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

    Why it matters?
        If you just call an LLM API, it forgets context.
        RAG helps connect AI to real-world business data → think of an LLM that retrieves company-specific info instead of guessing.
    What to Learn?
        OpenAI Embeddings → https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings
        FAISS (Facebook’s vector search) → https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
        Pinecone for AI-powered search → https://www.pinecone.io/
    Hands-on:
        Instead of just using ChatGPT API, build a knowledge-based assistant → Train it on CERN papers!

✅ 3. Model Fine-Tuning & Open-Source LLMs (Optional but Valuable)

    Why it matters?
        Companies want custom AI models, not just OpenAI’s API.
        Fine-tuning = making a smaller AI model trained on company-specific data.
    What to Learn?
        Hugging Face Transformers → https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index
        LoRA fine-tuning → https://huggingface.co/blog/peft
        Open-source models like Mistral, Llama-3 → https://huggingface.co/models
    Hands-on:
        Try fine-tuning a smaller LLM on a physics dataset or financial dataset!

✅ 4. AI Deployment & MLOps for LLMs

    Why it matters?
        Just building an AI model isn’t enough—companies want it deployed at scale.
        Need to serve AI models efficiently, just like ML models.
    What to Learn?
        FastAPI for LLM APIs → https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
        Docker for packaging AI apps (you already know Docker!)
        LangChain for AI pipelines → https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction
    Hands-on:
        Deploy your chatbot as a real-world API instead of a local script.

**Full Plan**

🚀 Finalized Project Plan: NutriBabyAI – AI-Powered Baby Nutrition Assistant

📌 Goal: Build a conversational AI chatbot that helps parents with baby food recommendations.
✅ The user interacts only in natural language (NL → NL).
✅ Internally, we use structured AI workflows to retrieve and generate responses.
✅ The project follows industry-standard AI practices (RAG, APIs, CI/CD).
✅ The end goal is to deploy the chatbot so it is accessible online.
📌 Project Breakdown & Study Plan

💡 Total Estimated Time: ~3 Weeks (6-8 hours per week)
Phase	What We’ll Do	Learning Resources	Estimated Time
Phase 1: FastAPI Setup & Basic API	Set up FastAPI and create a simple API that responds to user input.	📖 FastAPI Docs: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/	4 hours
Phase 2: Integrate OpenAI API	Connect GPT-4 to generate baby food recommendations based on user input.	📖 OpenAI API Docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/	4 hours
Phase 3: Extract Structured Data from NL	Teach the chatbot to extract "baby age" & "ingredients" from free-text queries.	📖 Prompt Engineering Guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering	6 hours
