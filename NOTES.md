# Want to Learn the following

Companies today are hyping AI integration, especially LLMs (Large Language Models) like ChatGPT, and they want to know if candidates can use, build, and deploy AI-powered applications.

Since you’ve already used the OpenAI API to build a chatbot, you have some exposure! But let’s break down what’s actually important to learn so you don’t feel left behind.
🔹 What Companies Mean by "Do You Know AI Integration?"

They’re asking if you can:
✅ Use LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) via APIs to automate workflows.
✅ Fine-tune or train models for specific company needs.
✅ Deploy AI-powered applications (chatbots, search engines, document summarization tools).
✅ Optimize and customize AI models (prompt engineering, embeddings, RAG).

So, yes—your pizza-order chatbot is a basic example of AI integration! But in industry, companies want LLMs embedded into their products and workflows for:

    Customer support automation (Chatbots for finance, healthcare, HR).
    AI-driven search & recommendation systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG).
    Summarization & report generation (LLMs analyzing documents).

🔹 Key AI Skills to Learn for Industry (Without Overload!)

Here’s what will actually help you get noticed without wasting time on hype:
✅ 1. LLM APIs & Chatbot Development (You already started!)

    How to use OpenAI, Claude, Gemini APIs for building AI-powered apps.
    What to Learn?
        OpenAI API (GPT-4) → https://platform.openai.com/docs/
        LangChain → https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction (Framework for LLM apps).
        Hands-on: Make your chatbot smarter by adding memory, knowledge base (vector database).

✅ 2. Embeddings & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

    Why it matters?
        If you just call an LLM API, it forgets context.
        RAG helps connect AI to real-world business data → think of an LLM that retrieves company-specific info instead of guessing.
    What to Learn?
        OpenAI Embeddings → https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings
        FAISS (Facebook’s vector search) → https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
        Pinecone for AI-powered search → https://www.pinecone.io/
    Hands-on:
        Instead of just using ChatGPT API, build a knowledge-based assistant → Train it on CERN papers!

✅ 3. Model Fine-Tuning & Open-Source LLMs (Optional but Valuable)

    Why it matters?
        Companies want custom AI models, not just OpenAI’s API.
        Fine-tuning = making a smaller AI model trained on company-specific data.
    What to Learn?
        Hugging Face Transformers → https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index
        LoRA fine-tuning → https://huggingface.co/blog/peft
        Open-source models like Mistral, Llama-3 → https://huggingface.co/models
    Hands-on:
        Try fine-tuning a smaller LLM on a physics dataset or financial dataset!

✅ 4. AI Deployment & MLOps for LLMs

    Why it matters?
        Just building an AI model isn’t enough—companies want it deployed at scale.
        Need to serve AI models efficiently, just like ML models.
    What to Learn?
        FastAPI for LLM APIs → https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
        Docker for packaging AI apps (you already know Docker!)
        LangChain for AI pipelines → https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction
    Hands-on:
        Deploy your chatbot as a real-world API instead of a local script.

# Plan

🚀 3-Day Plan: FastAPI & AI Chatbot for Baby Nutrition (NutriBabyAI)

📌 Goal: Set up a FastAPI-powered chatbot that provides baby food recommendations and is fully tested & committed to GitHub within 3 days.

✅ By the end of Day 3, you'll have:

    A working FastAPI backend.
    Deployed API endpoints that handle requests.
    Basic chatbot logic using OpenAI's API.
    GitHub repo updated with your progress.

📌 Day 1: Setting Up FastAPI & First API Endpoint

⏳ Time Estimate: ~2.5 hours
✅ Step 1: Project Folder Setup & Environment (30 min)

📚 Learning Resources:

    📖 FastAPI Quickstart: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ (Read the "First Steps" section)
    📖 Python Virtual Environments: https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/ (Why & how to use them?)

📌 Tasks:
1️⃣ Open VS Code & Clone Repo:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/NutriBabyAI.git
cd NutriBabyAI
code .

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment & Activate It:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

3️⃣ Install FastAPI & Uvicorn:

pip install fastapi uvicorn

✅ Step 2: Create Your First API Endpoint (1 hour)

📚 Learning Resources:

    📖 FastAPI Routes & Endpoints: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/
    📖 HTTP Methods in FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/
