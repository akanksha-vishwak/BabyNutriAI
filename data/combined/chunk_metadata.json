If your baby already has an allergy, such as a diagnosed food allergy or eczema, or if you have a family history of food allergies, eczema, asthma or hay fever, you may need to be particularly careful when introducing foods. Talk to your GP or health visitor first. Foods that can trigger an allergic reaction include: - cows' milk - eggs (eggs without a red lion stamp should not be eaten raw or lightly cooked) - foods that contain gluten, including wheat, barley and rye - nuts and peanuts (serve them finely ground or as nut butters) - beans, lentils and peas - seeds, particularly sesame seeds (serve seeds finely ground) -",

Once introduced and if tolerated, these foods should become part of your baby's usual diet to minimise the risk of allergy. Evidence has shown that delaying the introduction of peanut and hen's eggs beyond 6 to 12 months may increase the risk of developing an allergy to these foods.

If your child has a food allergy, read food labels carefully. Avoid foods if you're not sure whether they contain the food your child is allergic to. How to tell if your child has a food allergy Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen, although sometimes they can happen more slowly (over a few hours or days). They can cause: - sneezing - a runny or blocked nose - red, itchy, watery eyes - wheezing and coughing - a red, itchy rash - worsening of [asthma](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/)or[eczema](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atopic-eczema/)symptoms - feeling or being sick - tummy pain, diarrhoea or constipation Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called [anaphylaxis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anaphylaxis/) or anaphylactic shock can occur.
