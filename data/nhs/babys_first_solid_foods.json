    "chunk": "Introducing your baby to solid foods, sometimes called complementary feeding or weaning, should start when your baby is around 6 months old. At the beginning, how much your baby eats is less important than getting them used to the idea of eating. They'll still be getting most of their energy and nutrients from breast milk or first infant formula. Giving your baby a variety of foods, alongside breast or formula milk, from around 6 months of age will help set your child up for a lifetime of healthier eating. Gradually, you'll be able to increase the amount and variety of food your baby eats until they can eat the same foods as the rest of the family, in smaller portions. If your baby was born prematurely, ask your health visitor or GP for advice on when to start introducing solid foods. Why wait until around 6 months to introduce solids?",

Feeding your baby: from 10 to 12 months From about 10 months, your baby should now be having 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch and tea), in addition to their usual milk feeds. Around this age, your baby may have about 3 milk feeds a day (for instance, after breakfast, after lunch and before bed). Breastfed babies will adapt their milk consumption as their food intake changes. As a guide, babies fed infant formula will drink about 400ml daily. Remember that formula-fed babies should take a [vitamin D supplement](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/weaning-and-feeding/vitamins-for-children/) if they're having less than 500ml of formula a day. All breastfed babies should take a vitamin D supplement. By now, your baby should be enjoying a wide range of tastes and textures. They should be able to manage a wider range of finger foods, and be able to pick up small pieces of food",

You can keep breastfeeding for as long as it suits you both, but your child will need less breast milk to make room for more foods. Once your child is 12 months old, formula milks are not needed. This includes first infant formula, follow-on formula, growing-up milks and other toddler milks. Your baby can now drink pasteurised whole or semi-skimmed cows' milk. Choose full-fat dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fromage frais, as children under 2 years old need the vitamins and extra energy found in them.
