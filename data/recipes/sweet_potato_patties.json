Heat half the oil over a moderate heat in a pan. Cook half the patties for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Add the remaining oil and cook the rest of the patties. Drain on a paper towel. Once cooled, serve on a plate as finger food. Weaning tip Let your baby guide you on how much they want to eat. They'll show you when they're full by pushing food back out of their mouth, turning their head, clamping their mouth shut or becoming distracted.",
