Put the onion, garlic, mushrooms, courgettes, canned tomatoes, mixed herbs and water into a large saucepan, bring to the boil, cover and then simmer gently until all the vegetables are cooked (approximately 15 to 20 minutes). Add a little more water during cooking if needed. While the vegetables are cooking, place the haddock in an ovenproof dish and bake (or you can steam) for 20 minutes until fully cooked. Meanwhile place the pasta in a small pan with cold water, bring to boil and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until pasta is soft. Chop or mince the cooked fish and vegetables to the desired consistency. Place ¼ of the ratatouille in a bowl and serve with the cooked pasta (either as a finger food, or mashed with the fish and vegetables). Add a side portion of cooked green veg",
