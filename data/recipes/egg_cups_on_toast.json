Meanwhile, put 2 tbsp water and the quartered cherry tomatoes in a small saucepan. Heat gently for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes are soft (if the tomatoes start sticking, add a little water). Then set aside. Turn out the breakfast cups onto a rack and allow to cool a little. Toast the bread, spread with vegetable spread, then cut into fingers. Serve 2 breakfast cups with the toast, mashed tomatoes and a spoon. Weaning tip Remember: cut small round foods like cherry tomatoes into small pieces to avoid choking.",
