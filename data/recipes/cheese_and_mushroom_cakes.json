Add the cheese, leeks, mushrooms and chives to the mash potato. Mix well. Pre-heat oven to 180C, 350F, gas mark 4. Shape into 8 to 10 small patties that fit in palm of your hand. Put the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs into 3 separate bowls. Coat each cake in turn (flour first, then egg and lastly breadcrumbs). Place the potato cakes on a baking tray in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Once cooled, serve 1 cake on a plate for your baby to pick up and eat. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for the next day, or put in freezer for longer storage. Defrost",
