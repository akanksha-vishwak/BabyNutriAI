Cook for 20 to 30 minutes until the meat and veg are cooked and the sauce has thickened. In the meantime, bring a pan of water to the boil, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until soft. Then drain. Put the pasta in a bowl, place quarter of the bolognese mix over the top and serve with a fork. Swap the beef mince for lentils or soya mince for a vegetarian alternative.
