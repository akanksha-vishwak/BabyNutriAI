Pour over the water, simmer gently with the lid on for 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is tender and the vegetables are cooked. Allow to cool. Chop or mince the biryani until it is smooth with soft lumps. Serve a quarter of it in a bowl. Serve with cooked cauliflower florets as a finger food. Family feedback This veggie biryani was a hit for baby and the entire family! It took me less than 20 minutes to make and it was delish. You've got to try it! Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals - rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
