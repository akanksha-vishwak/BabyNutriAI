Add the remaining ingredients, bring to the boil, cover and then simmer (stirring occasionally) for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are cooked. Spread the bread with the vegetable oil spread, cut into fingers. Place quarter of the stew in a bowl and serve with a spoon and the bread on the side. Freeze the rest of the stew in an airtight container. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals – rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
