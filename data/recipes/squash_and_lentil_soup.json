Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes until the veg is soft and the lentils are cooked. Add a little more water during cooking if needed. Set aside to cool a little before mashing until smooth but with some soft lumps for your baby to try lumpier textures. Then put ¼ of the soup into a bowl, and freeze the other three portions for other days. Toast the slice of bread and cut into toasted fingers to go on the side. Serve the soup with a spoon to encourage your baby to practice self-feeding. You can swap the butternut squash for sweet potato or pumpkin. Or why not go for a mix for your baby to try different flavour combinations.",
