Simmer for a further 5 to 10 minutes until the chicken, vegetables and noodles are cooked. Add a little water during cooking if needed. Blend the soup, or chop noodles into small pieces. Put quarter of the noodles in a bowl, and allow to cool a little before serving with a spoon or fork. Use frozen sweetcorn instead of tinned if preferred. Remember fresh, frozen, tinned, dried and juiced fruit and vegetables all count towards your 5 A Day. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals - rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
