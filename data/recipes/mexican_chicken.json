On a medium heat, cook the chicken and vegetable mixture in a frying pan for 10 to 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables have softened. Meanwhile slice the pitta bread into fingers. Blend or mash the cooked chicken mix until smooth with soft lumps, or slice to serve as a finger food. Keep some pepper strips whole. Serve ¼ chicken mixture on a plate with the cooked pepper strips, strips of pitta and a small spoonful of full fat yoghurt. Freeze the other 3 portions to use on other days.",
