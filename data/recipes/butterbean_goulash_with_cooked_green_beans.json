    "chunk": "trimmed Method Chop the vegetables and garlic. Heat the oil in a pan and add the onions. Cook for a few minutes. Add the pepper, mushrooms, carrot, garlic, beans, paprika, canned tomatoes and water – stir well. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. In the meantime, steam or boil the green beans for 5 to 6 minutes until soft. Once cooled a little, blend or mash the goulash until smooth (but with soft lumps). Serve with the green beans as a finger food. Freeze any leftovers in an ice cube tray for handy portions on other days. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals - rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
