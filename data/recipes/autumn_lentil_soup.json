Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes until the veg is soft and the lentils are cooked. Add a little more water during cooking if needed. Set aside to cool a little before blending or mashing until smooth. Then put ¼ of the soup into a bowl, and freeze the other 3 portions for other days. Toast the slice of bread and cut into toasted fingers to go on the side. Try serving with some cooked vegetable sticks as a finger food such as broccoli, green beans or courgette.",
