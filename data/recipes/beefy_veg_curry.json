Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes until the beef is cooked through and tender. Add a little extra water during cooking if needed. Meanwhile, in a separate pan of water add the rice and cook for approx. 10 minutes until cooked. Then drain. Whilst the curry and rice are cooking, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the peas and cook for 5 minutes or so minutes until soft. You can microwave if preferred. Roughly chop the spinach, add to the curry pan and cook for a further 3 or 4 minutes. Serve ¼ of the curry in a bowl with a spoon or fork, with the rice and the cooked peas on the side as a finger food.",
