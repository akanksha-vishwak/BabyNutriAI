Add a little more water during cooking if needed. While the vegetables are cooking, place the haddock in an ovenproof dish and bake (or you can steam) for 20 minutes until fully cooked. Meanwhile place the pasta in a small pan with cold water, bring to boil and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until pasta is soft. Blend or mash the cooked fish and vegetables until smooth with soft lumps. Place ¼ of the ratatouille in a bowl and serve with the cooked pasta (either as a finger food, or mashed with the fish and vegetables). Your baby may find smaller pasta shapes easier to eat.",
