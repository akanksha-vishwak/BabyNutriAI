Pour over the water, simmer gently with the lid on for 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is tender and the vegetables are cooked. Allow to cool. Serve a quarter of the biryani in a bowl. Serve with cooked cauliflower florets as a finger food. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals – rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
