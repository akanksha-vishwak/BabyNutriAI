Add the water until the rice and vegetables are covered and stir. Cover and simmer gently until the majority of the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, approx 10 minutes. Check to see if the rice is cooked, if not, add more water and continue to simmer until cooked. Flake in half the salmon and combine well. Blend or mash the cooked risotto until it is smooth with soft lumps. Serve with the cooked red pepper sticks as a finger food. Instead of baking fresh or frozen salmon use tinned salmon (drained) flaked into the risotto.",
