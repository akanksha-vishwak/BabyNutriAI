Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the onions, garlic and mushrooms until softened (2 to 3 minutes). Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, water and peas – stir, cover and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes (until the sauce has thickened slightly). Add the basil and diced ham. Pour the sauce over the pasta and mix well. Place in the oven for 10 minutes. Allow to cool. Serve a quarter in a bowl with fork or spoon. Make it veggie by swapping the ham for soya pieces.
