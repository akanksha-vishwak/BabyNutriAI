Cover and simmer gently until the majority of the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, approx 10 minutes. Meanwhile slice the red pepper into finger sticks. Check to see if the rice is cooked, if not, add more water and continue to simmer until cooked. Flake in half the baked salmon and combine well. Serve with red pepper sticks on the side. For a vegetarian alternative, swap the salmon for broad beans and cook at the same time as the peas. Instead of baking fresh or frozen salmon, you can use tinned salmon (drained) flaked into the risotto.",
