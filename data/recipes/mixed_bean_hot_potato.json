Blend or mash 1/4 of the cooked chilli with 1/3 of the cooked potato until it is smooth with soft lumps. Serve in a bowl with a spoon. Place the remaining 3 portions of chilli in secure containers and freeze for other days. Have the leftover potato as part of your own dinner, or put in the fridge and offer as a snack the next day. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals - rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
