On a medium heat, cook the chicken and vegetable mixture in a frying pan for 10 to 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables have softened. Place ¼ of the chicken and vegetable mix in centre of the tortilla, with a small spoonful of yoghurt and roll up tightly. Cut into smaller sections if it’s easier for your baby to handle. You could serve with 15g grated cheese and some mashed avocado.",
