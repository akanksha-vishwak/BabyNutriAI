Meanwhile, put 2 tbsp water and the quartered cherry tomatoes in a small saucepan. Heat gently for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes are soft (if the tomatoes start sticking, add a little water). Then set aside. Turn the breakfast cups onto a rack and allow to cool a little. Toast the bread, spread with vegetable spread, then cut into fingers. Serve 1 breakfast cup with the toast, mashed tomatoes and a spoon. Encourage your baby to touch and explore any new foods you offer. Weaning tip Give your baby sips of water with their meals - rather than sweet drinks which can cause tooth decay.",
