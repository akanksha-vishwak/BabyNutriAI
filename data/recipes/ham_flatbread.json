Meanwhile, slice the ham and mushrooms and grate the cheese. Place a frying pan over a low to medium heat. Cook the flatbread pizza base(s) until crisp and golden on one side (approx. 5 minutes), then turn and repeat. Transfer to a baking sheet. Spread the tomatoes over the bread base then top with the ham, mushrooms and cheese. Place the flatbread under the grill until the cheese is bubbling and the vegetables are soft (5 to 10 minutes). Divide into portions, then cut 1 portion of flatbread into strips. Check it's not too hot before serving (cut off any hard bits of outer base). Freeze the remaining flatbread in strips for other days. Just defrost and heat thoroughly before",
