Cover and leave to marinade in the fridge for 5 minutes. On a medium heat, cook the chicken and vegetable mixture in a frying pan for 10 to 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables have softened. Meanwhile slice the pitta bread into fingers. Chop or mince the cooked chicken (keeping some pepper strips whole), or slice to serve as a finger food. Serve a quarter on a plate with the cooked pepper strips, strips of pitta bread and spoonful of full-fat yoghurt. For a vegetarian alternative, swap the chicken for soya pieces or mixed beans.",
