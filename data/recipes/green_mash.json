Age: 6 months or older Prep: 5 mins Cook: 8 mins Portions: 8 (approx) Ingredients - 1 medium courgette (approx 200g), washed and chopped - 100g frozen peas Method Bring a pan of water to the boil. Place the courgette and peas in the pan and cook for around 8 minutes until tender. Drain and allow to cool a little. Blend (or mash together with a fork) until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add a little full-fat milk or your baby's usual milk. Cool down before serving. Freeze any leftovers in small pots or ice cube trays. Information: Add a little bit of cheese for a stronger flavour. Weaning tip Vegetables that aren't so sweet like peas, courgettes and broccoli, help your baby get used to other flavours.",
