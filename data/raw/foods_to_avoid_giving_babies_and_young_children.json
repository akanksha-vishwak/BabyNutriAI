This includes hard cheeses, such as mild cheddar cheese, cottage cheese and cream cheese. Babies and young children should not eat mould-ripened soft cheeses, such as brie or camembert, or ripened goats' milk cheese and soft blue-veined cheese, such as roquefort. There's a higher risk that these cheeses might carry a bacteria called listeria. Many cheeses are made from unpasteurised milk. It's better to avoid these because of the risk of listeria. You can check labels on cheeses to make sure they're made from pasteurised milk. But these cheeses can be used as part of a cooked recipe as listeria is killed by cooking. Baked brie, for example, is a safer option.",
