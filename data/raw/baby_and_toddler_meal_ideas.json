These are not suitable as first foods but are fine once your baby is used to eating a wide range of solid foods. [Read more about your baby's first solid foods](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/weaning-and-feeding/babys-first-solid-foods/). When preparing food for babies, do not add sugar or salt (including stock cubes and gravy) directly to the food or to the cooking water. Full-fat cheese, yoghurt and fromage frais are recommended up to the age of 2 years. But itâ€™s ok to give lower fat options over the age of 2.
